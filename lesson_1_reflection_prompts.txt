What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    For coding, it is very likely that we need to modify different files together like c header files and codes
	Fro google docs, different files are pretty independent of each other

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to see the note of the history of files, git diff to see the difference between two files
