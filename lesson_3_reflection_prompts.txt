When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when you are travelling or only have access to another computer, 
    when you are collaborating with other people 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    One could be that you are in the middle of coding or havn't finished one logical move
    Another could be when you collaborating with other people, 
    you do not want to change other people's work or to be changed by other people. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork copy someone else's repository in github to be a repository in your github
    clones can let you copy repository from remote(github) to local or copy from local to local
    branch does not involve the whole repository, branch copy a commit and 
    make it possible for future experiments without changing the master (mature version)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
